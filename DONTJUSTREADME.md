## Prologue
    
I absolutely remember when I was *programming* in primary school, most of my classmates were having the hardest 1 hour and 15 minutes in their 10 y-o life. Today, 10 years later, while I’m still struggling on how to make a lightbulb turn on in my uni lesson, Facebook announced their new name Meta to "reflect its focus on building the metaverse" . However, I also feel concerned when I keep failing to make the lights on as I want.

## What could go wrong?
You might say“Well stop finding excuses from learning to code! There’s a bunch of free resources you can use! Stop being lazy!”But do think Why I can access those “free” resources. I pay for my degree to watch those tutorials on LinkedIn Learn-in; I pay for a wireless router to connect internet; I pay for food and living to develop more instead of worrying about my primary needs of life, etc. Although I was lucky enough to afford these, not everyone does.


LeaveHomeSafe is a digital contact tracing app launched by the Hong Kong Government, and forcing people to use it when entering a various premises. This has had a serious impact on the daily lives of many elderly people, people with financial difficulties and the visual impaired, who can often be seen wandering helplessly in front of buildings. There are even homeless people who question whether they can take a shower in a public toilet. It is heartbreaking. When I feel a bit behind just because I can't light the lightbulb, these people are desperately left behind by the whole society. 
    
    The gap between the technical modern world and left-behinds 
    is being massive.
    
>(especially human is terrible at predicting 
the speed of development)

    
The reason for proving the gap is because I find this discrepancy also occurs in the development of art and technology. There is a balance between commercialisation and popularisation, but art today is still portrayed as a sophisticated discipline, sometimes even considered inaccessible by the public because of its many esoteric terms, and sometimes it's artificial. Yet art has belonged to the masses. It is not that art must be accessible to everyone, but that it should be more accessible to a more diverse audience, and free to express “ I can’t understand!”without feeling ashamed. This also applies to technology, which should benefit more people than just the most advanced technology in people's dreams, especially as it affects people's lives more directly.

## So whats next?
    
I am surprised at how much thought and information a small light bulb can cause me to gather, and as a person who benefits from art and technology, I expect I can be more open to different knowledge, remove the professional terms and transform it into the generic design, also extract as many of my comments as I can warn myself. This is not a solution to this huge gap, but we must first recognize the problem so we can talk about it. 
    
Yet now I need to check to see what's been wrong with my code.
